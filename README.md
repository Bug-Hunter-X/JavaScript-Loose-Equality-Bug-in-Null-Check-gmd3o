# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to loose equality (==) when checking for null values.  The bug arises from the fact that loose equality does not distinguish between null and other falsy values such as 0, an empty string, or undefined.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug errors.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a function `foo(x)` that attempts to check if the input `x` is null. However, it uses loose equality (`==`) instead of strict equality (`===`).  This means that the function will return 0 not only when `x` is null, but also when `x` is 0.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file corrects the bug by using strict equality (`===`). This ensures that the function only returns 0 when `x` is explicitly null, preventing unintended behavior with other falsy values.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in a JavaScript environment (e.g., your browser's console or Node.js).
3. Call the `foo` function with different inputs (including null, 0, and other values) to observe the difference in behavior between the buggy and corrected versions.
